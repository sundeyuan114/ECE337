2 clock cycles for data_ready must assert to reach zero state.
3 clock cycles for data must assert for after data_ready is asserted reach store state.

It looks like different type of edge detector in computer vision. One is horizontal, one vertical and one for both direction.


general file input IO:

		in_file = $fopen(INPUT_FILENAME, "rb");
		// Read in the Bitmap file header information (data is stored in little-endian (LSB first) format)
		for(i = 0; i < BMP_HEADER_SIZE_BYTES; i = i + 1) // Read the data in LSB format
		begin
			// Read a byte at a time
			quiet_catch = $fscanf(in_file,"%c" , in_bmp_file_header[i]);
		end


only %c in our case,
but fscanf can take something else like %d %f %s
